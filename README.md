# SQL_Analysis_Car_Sales
#data exploration
#data querying 

In this SQL project having only one table i.e, the car sales data table, I have done an exploratary analysis using basic SQL queries
like Select,Where,Group by, Order by, limit,offset

The raw dataset was downloaded from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/suraj520/car-sales-data

I used MySQL Workbench and imported the Excel file by converting it to csv file to a SQL Database in my local machine to carry forward with the analysis.
